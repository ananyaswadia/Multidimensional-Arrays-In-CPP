# Multidimensional-Arrays-In-CPP
## Aim
To study and implement different multi-dimensional arrays/ matrix operations in C++.
## Tools
Visual Studio Code 
## Theory 
A multi-dimensional array can be defined as an array that has more than one dimension. Having more than one dimension means that it can grow in multiple directions. Some popular multidimensional arrays include 2D arrays which grows in two dimensions, and 3D arrays which grows in three dimensions.

2D Arrays:

## Algorithms
### Addition of 2 matrices
### Multiplication of 2 matrices
### Adding diagonal elements of a matrix
### Transpose of a matrix
## Conclusion
