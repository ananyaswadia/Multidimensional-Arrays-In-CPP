# Multidimensional-Arrays-In-CPP
## Aim
To study and implement different multi-dimensional arrays/ matrix operations in C++.
## Tools
Visual Studio Code 
## Theory 
A multi-dimensional array can be defined as an array that has more than one dimension. Having more than one dimension means that it can grow in multiple directions. Some popular multidimensional arrays include 2D arrays which grows in two dimensions, and 3D arrays which grows in three dimensions.

2D Arrays:

## Algorithms
### Addition of 2 matrices
1. Start.

2. Input number of rows and columns for Matrix 1 → r1, c1.

3. Input number of rows and columns for Matrix 2 → r2, c2.

4. Check if r1 != r2 or c1 != c2:

5. If true → print “Invalid rows or columns.” and exit.

6. Declare 2D arrays m1[r1][c1] and m2[r2][c2].

7. Input elements of Matrix 1.

8. Display Matrix 1.

9. Input elements of Matrix 2.

10. Display Matrix 2.

11.  corresponding elements of both matrices and print the result.

12. End.
### Multiplication of 2 matrices
### Adding diagonal elements of a matrix
1. Start

2. Input number of rows r1 and columns c1.

3. Declare matrix m[r1][c1].

4. Input all elements of the matrix.

5. Display the matrix.

6. Initialize sum = 0.

7. For each row i from 0 to r1 - 1:

8. Add the element at the main diagonal m[i][i] to sum.

9. Display the value of sum.

10. End
### Transpose of a matrix
## Conclusion
We learnt how to perform some basic mathematical operations on 1 or more matrices.
